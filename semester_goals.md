# Semester goals

**Data mining is a practice of automatically searching large stores of data to discover patterns and trends that go beyond simple analysis.**

*Data mining is one of the most essential skill that one should learn these days as huge amounts of data is being generated. Due to digitization, every application or webisite is generating a huge amount of data. By the end of this semester I want to exell in Data mining and be ready for oppotunities.*

Few appplications of Data mining in real life are:
